This library contains code used to plot data collected at the iRIXS endstation of beamline 8.0.1.1 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). See the beamline website for more information: https://als.lbl.gov/beamlines/8-0-1/#8-0-1-1.
See here for more scientific details about the beamline: https://pubs.aip.org/aip/rsi/article/88/3/033106/1018572/High-efficiency-in-situ-resonant-inelastic-x-ray. 

The code was developed by members of the Chueh group at Stanford. See our website for more information: https://chuehlab.stanford.edu/.

There are several libraries - for XAS, RIXS and iPFY XAS (which requires integrating RIXS spectra).
