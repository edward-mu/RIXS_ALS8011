This library contains code used to plot data collected at the iRIXS endstation of beamline 8.0.1.1 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS). See the beamline website for more information: https://als.lbl.gov/beamlines/8-0-1/#8-0-1-1.

The code was developed by members of the Chueh group at Stanford. See our website for more information: https://chuehlab.stanford.edu/.

There are several libraries - for XAS, RIXS and iPFY XAS (which requires integrating RIXS spectra).
